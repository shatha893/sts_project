## What Did I use?

* I used react-create-app to create a react project.
* I also used json-server so that I can "mock" APIs to make my code upon.
* I also Used class based components.

* Also, there's the DELETE option where a person can delete the entry and a VIEW option where a person can view the entry.

* There's a search bar.
